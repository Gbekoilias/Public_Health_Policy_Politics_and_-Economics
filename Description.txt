The assignment requires a comprehensive analysis of a chosen public health intervention from political, policy, and economic perspectives, spanning 3000 words excluding references and appendices. It emphasizes the application of key concepts from political science, policy studies, and economic science. Students are encouraged to carefully select an intervention, considering its relevance to public health and the potential for addressing key issues in politics, policy, and economics. The assignment should cover the intervention's background, political factors shaping it, policy actors involved, ideological influences, problem representation, decision-making processes, implementation, effectiveness, and implications for public health practice. Clear use of concepts, frameworks, and theories is expected throughout, and the assignment should be well-structured with effective signposting and a strong concluding section. The assessment allows for the use of diagrams and charts, but their inclusion should be thoughtful. The UWE Harvard referencing system is required, and appendices, though not formally assessed, should add value and not be superfluous.
